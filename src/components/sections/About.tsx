            The MedLink Project was founded with a single goal in mind: to break down barriers and provide accessible, meaningful mentorship for aspiring medical students. As medical students ourselves, we understand how overwhelming the journey to medical school can be.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            From navigating applications to preparing for interviews, the process is not only complex but also costly. Many existing mentorship programs come with steep price tags, putting them out of reach for students who could benefit from them the most.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why we created The MedLink Projectâ€”to address these gaps and create a supportive community for students. We designed the program with accessibility and inclusivity at its core.
